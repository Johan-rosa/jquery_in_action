# Chapter 3: Collections

In jQuery collections are formed when a selector target multiples elements. For example, `$('p')` would create a collection with all the paragraphs in a page. 

### How to access collections elements

There are multiples ways to access collection's elements. Collections are like js arrays, so you can use index to do it. There are methods for this as well, like the `.get()`.

An importa note on theses optios is that they return DOM objects, not jQuery elements. 

```js
var imgElement = $('img[alt]')[0];
var imgElement2 = $('p').get(0)
```
In case you need a jQuery object and not a normal DOM element, you have two basic options:

```js
// First (Not elegant)
$($('p')[0])

//Second (better)
$('p').eq(0)
$('p:peq(0)')
```

**Some interesting methods**

```js

$('p').fist()
$('p:fist')

$('p').last()
$('p:last')
```
